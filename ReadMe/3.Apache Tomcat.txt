+ Components of Tomcat Server.	
	- Catalina:
		Servlet container/engine for Apache Tomcat
	- Jasper:
		JSP container/engine for Apache Tomcat
	- Coyote:
		It is a Connector component for Tomcat. It listens for 			incoming connections to the server on a specific TCP port 			and forwards the request to the Tomcat Engine to process 			the request and send back a response to the requesting 			client. 

+ Installation directory of Apache tomcat
	- bin:
		 - Contains Start/Stop scripts for tomcat for both windows  and linux operating system.
	- conf:
		- Contains main configuration files (web.xml and server.xml) to configure tomcat server.
	- lib:
		- It contains java archive( .jar ) files needed by Tomcat to run the application.
		 These jar file contains  implementation of Java EE specification.
		It is shared  among all the web applications.
	- logs:
		- This is where Tomcat places its log files by default.
	- temp:
		- It contains temporary files.

	- webapps:
		* This directory is called "Hot Deployment" directoy.
		 Without stopping server, we can deploy java web  application here.
		Any .war file placed here will be  automatically expanded.
		* If we want to deploy JEE application here then either we  should create and 
		copy .war file or we should 		  create JEE compliant directory structure here.
		* JEE compliant directory structure:
			+ Web Application
				|- .html, .jsp, .css, image files
				|- WEB-INF
					|- web.xml
					|- src( optional )
					|   |- .java files
					|- classes
					|   |- .class files
					|- lib
					    |- external .jar files
	
	- work:
		- Tomcat places intermediate file(such as compiled jsp 	files) during its work.
		 If we delete this directory  while tomcat is running then we will not be able to  execute jsp pages.


+ Connector and default port.
	Http			8080

	Https			8443

	Ajp12Connector		8007

+ Steps to configure and run tomcat without IDE.
	1. Extract tomcat archive.

	2. Launch "Tomcat server" from <tomcat>/bin => ./catalina.sh run 

	3. Run web browser using URL : http://localhost:8080
	   It should display welcome page.


+ Command to start and stop tomcat server:
	1. /home/sandeep/apache-tomcat-8.5.29/bin#./catalina.sh run
	2. /home/sandeep/apache-tomcat-8.5.29/bin#./shutdown.sh


+ Steps to enable manager login:
	1. Edit <tomcat>/conf/tomcat-users.xml  as follows
	
		<tomcat-users>
			<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
			<user	username="root"
				password="manager"
				roles="manager-gui"/>
		</tomcat-users>
	2. Launch "Tomcat server".
	3. Hit the URL : http://localhost:8080
