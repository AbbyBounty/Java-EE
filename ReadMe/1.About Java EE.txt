+ What is Java EE?
	- Java EE / JEE is also called as Enterprise Java / Advanced Java.
	- Java EE is a specification defined by Sun/Oracle. It is super set of Java SE.
	- It is a collection of interfaces and abstract classes.
	- Current version of Java EE is 8.
	- Anbody can implement Java EE specification but generally web server and application server vendors implement it.
	- Following are the Java EE Specifications:
		1. Servlet
		2. WebSocket
		3. JSP( Java Server Pages )
		4. JSF( Java Server Faces )
		5. EJB( Enterprise Java Bean )
		6. JPA( Java Persistence API )
		7. JTA( Java Transaction API )
		8. JMS( Java Message Service )
 
+ Web Server:
	- Dedicated server software which processes incoming network requests over the HTTP protocol.
	- It is responsible for taking care of presentation logic. In  other words,
	 it is designed to serve HTTP content.
	- Web Server = Web Container + Extra Services
		* Web Container = Servlet container + JSP Container
		* Extra Services = Security,Connection pooling,JNDI etc	
	- Example of web server:
		1. Tomcat( Apache Foundation )
		2. Jetty(  Eclipse Foundation )
		3. Resin( Caucho Technology )
		4. LiteSpeed Web Server( LiteSpeed Technologies )
		5. Mongoose( Cesanta Software  )

+ Application Server:
	- Dedicated server software which processes incoming network requests over the HTTP, RMI/RPC etc. protocol.
	- It is responsible for taking care of presentation logic as well as business logic.
	- App server = Web Container + EJB Container + Extra services
		* Extra Services:
			1. Connection Pooling
			2. Object Pooling
			3. Transaction Support
			4. Messaging Services etc.
	- Example of Application server:
		1. TomEE( Apache Foundation ). TomEE = Tomcat + Java EE.
		2. Geronimo( Apache Foundation )
		3. GlassFish( Oracle )
		4. WebLogic( Oracle )
		5. WebSphere( IBM )
		6. WildFly-Formerly JBoss( Red Hat )
		7. Enhydra( Lutris  Technologies )
+ Which are the types of container?
	- The Java EE specification lists 4 types of containers:
	    1. Applet Container	  
		* Manages the execution of applets.
		* Consists of a web browser and a Java Plug-in running on 			  the client together.
	    2. Application Client Container
		* Manages the execution of application client components. 
		* Application clients and their container run on the client.
	    3. Web Container
		* Manages the execution of web pages, servlets, and some  EJB components for Java EE applications.
		* Web components and their container run on the Java EE 		  server.
	    4. EJB Container
		* Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE  applications. 
		* Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE 			  server.

+ Why Java EE?
	1. It supports different types of clients:
		- Thin client	-> Web browser
		- Thick client	-> desktop application
		- Smart client  -> mobile application

	2. It gives us JEE server independence:
		We can develop and deploy server side application on any JEE compliant server which guaranteed to produce same 			results without touching or re-deploying on any other JEE 			server.

	3. Ready made implementation of primary services:
		For example:
			- security
			- connection pooling
			- email
		Java EE developer doesnt have to worry about primary services.
	     He/she can concentrate on actual business logic.
